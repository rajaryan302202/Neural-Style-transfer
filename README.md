# Workshop on Neural Style Transfer

The following content are for the workshop held on 28th Feb, 2020, on the topic **Neural Style Transfer**

The three notebooks are as follows:
- [**Notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e1Rqu9a8FtTkeO5YX0PopvOfRk1Wf3tB#scrollTo=q3Cc3bLtoOWy)
- [**Slides**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11NMZ9N08mqB3XmV_Dfj6KosfNbOGaCCXRbFMJiLONs0/edit#slide=id.p)
- [**Solution**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kb10241024/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/master/Saver_Style_Transfer.ipynb#scrollTo=A1FxaswnNzpG)

We highly encourage you to fill up the missing snippets of code given in the **Notebook**, however you can consult the **Solution** if you are stuck somewhere.

If you want to read further about the algorithm, we highly encourage you to go through the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf) by Gatys et al.

Happy learning!!
